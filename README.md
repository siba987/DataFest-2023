# DataFest-2023
An analysis of 300,000 client-attorney records, visualizing equity-based attorney requirement needs based on client/attorney ratio


## These were the steps we took:

1.	**Data Segmentation:**
   
	•	Segment data based on key demographics (e.g., location, type of case, client age, attorney specialty).
3.	**Client/Attorney Ratio Analysis:**
   
	•	Calculate the client-to-attorney ratio across various segments.

	•	Identify trends and patterns in attorney workload and client distribution.
4.	**Equity-Based Needs Assessment:**
   
	•	Assess the distribution of attorney resources to ensure equitable representation.

	•	Highlight any disparities in attorney availability and client needs.
6.	**Visualization:**
   
	•	Create clear and informative visualizations (charts, graphs, heatmaps) to illustrate the findings.

	•	Used Tableau to present the data dynamically.
