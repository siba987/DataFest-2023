An analysis of 300,000 client-attorney records, visualizing equity-based attorney requirement needs based on client/attorney ratio


## These were the steps we took:

1.	**Data Segmentation:**
   
	•	Segment data based on key demographics (e.g., location, type of case, client age, attorney specialty).
3.	**Client/Attorney Ratio Analysis:**
   
	•	Calculate the client-to-attorney ratio across various segments.

	•	Identify trends and patterns in attorney workload and client distribution, namely **how long does it take on average to close cases in each state**.
4.	**Equity-Based Needs Assessment:**
   
	•	Assess the distribution of attorney resources to ensure equitable representation.

	•	Highlight any disparities in attorney availability and client needs.
6.	**Visualization:**
   
	•	Create clear and informative visualizations (charts, graphs, heatmaps) to illustrate the findings.

	•	Used Tableau to present the data dynamically.

 
## Main Findings:

Upon diving deeper into the data, we identified a notable discrepancy between the states that took the longest and shortest times to complete a case. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that states taking longer to complete cases would have a higher average number of cases per attorney, the opposite was true.

Further analysis revealed a similar data distribution between these two states, suggesting that other factors might be influencing the case completion times. This prompts the need for a more detailed examination of Attorney/Admin data as well as Sentiment Analysis and Customer Satisfaction scores to uncover underlying causes and improve case management efficiency.
